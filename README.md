## üéØ Overview

The **BMI Calculator** is a visually appealing, responsive web application that lets users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) using either metric or imperial units. It displays the BMI result, category, and personalized health messages, all wrapped in a modern and accessible UI.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Unit Support:** Input height in centimeters or feet/inches; weight in kilograms or pounds.
- **Smart Input:** Dynamic form adapts to selected units (shows feet/inches inputs for imperial).
- **Real-Time Validation:** Prevents invalid/negative values and ensures all required fields are filled.
- **Clear Output:** Shows BMI value, category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese), and health messages.
- **One-Click Reset:** Instantly recalculate with the "Calculate Again" button.
- **Instant Feedback:** Input errors are caught before calculation, with user-friendly alerts.
- **Animated & Responsive UI:** Stylish gradients, micro-animations, and mobile-first design.
- **Accessible:** Keyboard navigable, large touch targets, color-coded results, and semantic HTML.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User opens the app** and is greeted with a clean form.
2. **User enters weight and height,** selecting unit systems as needed.
3. **Form dynamically updates** for unit choices (e.g., shows feet/inches fields for height in ft/in).
4. **Upon 'Calculate BMI',** the app converts units (if necessary), validates inputs, and computes BMI.
5. **Result page** displays BMI value, color-coded category, and personalized health message.
6. **User can reset** to try new inputs or close the app.
